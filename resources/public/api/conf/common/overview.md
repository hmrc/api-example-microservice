This is an example API that allows software developers to test that their applications can connect with the HMRC API Platform. It also acts as a hands-on tutorial for developers to get started with HMRC APIs.

It includes resources for testing access to the three different access levels:

- *Say hello world* is an example of an unrestricted endpoint
- *Say hello user* is an example of a user-restricted endpoint
- *Say hello application* is an example of an application-restricted endpoint

Further details of the different access levels are given on the [Authorisation](/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.

For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, see [Tutorials](/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).
